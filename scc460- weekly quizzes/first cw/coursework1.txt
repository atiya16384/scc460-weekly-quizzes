# Task 1: Read the dataset, check variable names, and print dimensions
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the dataset (assuming the dataset is downloaded and stored locally as 'accidents2014.csv')
data <- read.csv("accidents2014.csv")

# Check the names of the variables and print dimensions
colnames(data)
dim(data)


# Task 2: Select relevant variables and filter for private cars and non-motorway roads
```{r}
data_filtered <- data %>%
  select(-Accident.Date, -Time..24hr., -Road.Surface, -Lighting.Conditions, -Weather.Conditions) %>%
  filter(Type.of.Vehicle == 9, X1st.Road.Class != 1)

# Print the dimensions of the modified data frame
dim(data_filtered)

# Task 3: Calculate the distance from the center of Leeds using Pythagoras' theorem and reorder by distance
# Coordinates of the centre of Leeds
```{r}
leeds_easting <- 429967
leeds_northing <- 434260

# Calculate the distance from the center of Leeds
data_with_distance <- data_filtered %>%
  mutate(Distance_from_Leeds = sqrt((Grid.Ref..Easting - leeds_easting)^2 + 
                                      (Grid.Ref..Northing - leeds_northing)^2)) %>%
  arrange(Distance_from_Leeds)

# Print the bottom few rows (those farthest from Leeds)
tail(data_with_distance)

# Task 4: Create a histogram of the age of casualties
```{r}
ggplot(data_with_distance, aes(x = Age.of.Casualty)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Casualty age", y = "No. of casualties")
